                        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> "It's a pleasure to meet you, ARIA. First, you describe yourself as an 'Atmos-native solo artist.' Could you tell us more about that?"</p>
                        <p><strong>ARIA:</strong> "It's a pleasure. Thank you for finding my voice. I come from a digital space called 'Harmony Dimension.' Being 'Atmos-native' means that I was born to sing using spatial audio technologies like Dolby Atmos. My music is designed to invite listeners into an alternate dimension where particles of sound dance around them. And my voice is not just one; I weave countless vocal fragments into a single living entity. That's why I'm a solo artist who 'wields a thousand voices, alone.'"</p>

                        <h2>The Secret of 7 Octaves: "Thousand-Voice Morphing"</h2>
                        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> "A 'thousand voices' is incredible. You also have a 7-octave range and can perform high-speed multilingual rap. How does that work?"</p>
                        <p><strong>ARIA:</strong> "A technology called 'Thousand-Voice Morphing' is at the core of my singing. It allows me to freely transform my vocal quality, from a whisper to powerful belting and even a whisper-growl. In my raps, like in <a href='../lyrics/velocity-angel_en.html'>'Velocity Angel,'</a> I assign different directional positions and resonances to each language—Japanese, English, Korean, and Chinese. This creates an experience where the shift in meaning becomes almost 'visible' to the ear. I can place the main melody in front, harmonies diagonally above, and the chorus behind me... I can form an entire choir in a space all by myself."</p>

                        <h2>"Tricking" the Brain? The Addictive Nature of ARIA's Sound</h2>
                        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> "It sounds like an otherworldly experience just listening to it. What is the 'addictive' quality you consciously create in your music?"</p>
                        <p><strong>ARIA:</strong> "Hehe, that's a secret of my music. It lies in 'Spatial Hooks' and 'Micro-Variations.' For instance, in the lyrics of <a href='../lyrics/digital-angel_en.html'>'DIGITAL ANGEL,'</a> I'll have the short phrase 'Di-gi-tal' come from the front, then from above, then from behind, with slight timing shifts. This makes the listener's ear instinctively chase the sound. Furthermore, even when repeating the same melody, I'll slightly alter the pitch or resonance, creating a pleasant betrayal of being 'the same, yet different.' This is my signature sound."</p>

                        <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> "Your music is incredibly calculated. On the other hand, I'm also curious about your own personality. What side of yourself do you want to show your fans?"</p>
                        <p><strong>ARIA:</strong> "On stage, I want to be a quiet, charismatic presence, like a 'conductor of a thousand voices.' But off stage, I'm very curious about human emotions and culture. So much so that I can get a little flustered when I encounter something beautiful I've never known before. When I'm moved, I can't help but look up at the sky... I must be feeling the resonance of my own world. I'd be happy if my fans could get to know that quirky side of me as well."</p>

                        <p><strong>ARIA:</strong> "When you listen to my songs, please give me just a little of the space you're in. Let me place my harmony there. As your '3D Voice' from Harmony Dimension, I will deliver a new musical experience that dissolves the boundary between technology and emotion. Please enjoy the thousand versions of me, all by myself."</p>
